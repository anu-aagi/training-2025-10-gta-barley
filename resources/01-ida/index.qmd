## What do you look for in a [good apple]{.highlight}?

```{css}
.red {
  color: #B1001C;
}
.highlight {
  background-color: #F0EDCC;
  padding: 7px;
  color: #02343F;
  font-weight: bold;
  transform: skew(-7deg);
  display: inline-block;
}

.box {
  background-color: #F0EDCC;
  color: #02343F;
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 20px;
  margin-bottom: 7px;
}
.box p:first-child {
  margin: 0!important;
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 20px!important;
}

.box P:first-child > strong {
  background-color: #02343F;
  color: #F0EDCC;
  width: 100%;
  padding: 20px;
}

```

- colour?
- scent? 
- firmness?

## How about for [data]{.highlight}?


well, that depends on your research question...

but there are some sniff tests you should do _before_ diving in!

## Data Analysis 



- **Data analysis** is a process of cleaning, transforming, inspecting and modelling data with the aim of extracting information.

. . .

**Exploratory data analysis**

- EDA is about exploration and discovering unknown insights.
- Flexible, iterative, visual for discovering, identifying, or formulating hypothesis.

"EDA is an attitude, a flexibility, and a reliance on display, NOT a bundle of techniques." -- Tukey (1980)

**Confirmatory data analysis**

- CDA is to test specific, pre-defined hypotheses using statistical methods.
- Structured, rigorous, statistical for testing, assessing, or concluding.
- Often only when the data is from an experimental study with a proper experimental design.

## Initial Data Analysis

::: incremental

- IDA is the crucial first step in analysing data, involving [inspection and exploration _before_ formal statistical analysis]{.highlight}. 
-  It helps to ensure data quality, identify potential issues, and refine the analysis plan, leading to more reliable and reproducible results. 
- Different name is used to describe the same process, such as:
  - Chatfield (1985) as **_"initial examination of data"_**,
  - Cox & Snell (1981) as **_"preliminary data analysis"_**, and 
  - Rao (1983) as **_"cross-examination of data"_**.

## Analysis Framework

::: {.column width="30%" .f2}

**Tidy data**

1. Each column is a variable.
2. Each row is an observation.
3. Each cell is a single value.

:::

::: box

**Tools**

- **Git/GitHub** for version control and collaboration
- Open-source programming languages (e.g. **R** and **Python**) for coding
- **Quarto** with **markdown syntax** for interoperable reproducible reports

## Data Description {.scrollable}

::: box

<b>ðŸŽ¯ Aim to assess the structure and quality of the data</b>

:::

- A non-exhaustive list of things to check could include:
  - Studying the **missing data** patterns 
  - **Numerical or graphical summaries** of univariate and multivariate distributions
    - Does the distribution of the data imply violations of assumptions for the main analysis?
    - Checking if data collection method is consistent across discrete set of variables
    - Plotting the data entry order across variables 
  - Identifying the **observational unit**
  - If a comparative experiment, 
    - Identify the **experimental unit** for every treatment factor
    - Be aware of **pseudo-replicates**!
    - Does the treatment group have different demographic characteristics to the control group?
    - Does the experimental layout match the description match? 
    - In particular, are treatments randomised?



## Sanity check your data 

::: incremental

- Also referred to as [**_data scrutinizing_**]{.highlight}.
- Use common or domain knowledge to [**_check if the recorded data have sensible values_**]{.highlight}. 
- For example:
  - Are positive values, e.g. height and weight, recorded as positive values with a plausible range?
  - If the data are counts, do the recorded values contain non-integer values?
  - For compositional data, do the values add up to 100% (or 1)? If not is that a measurement error or due to rounding? Or is another variable missing?
  - Are data encoded correctly?
- [**_Use independent or external sources_**]{.highlight} (quick Google or past published articles)
- Consider if or how [**_data were derived_**]{.highlight}
